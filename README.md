# Pokedex

A rudimentary application used to showcase the Model View Presenter design pattern, in addition to the combination of RxAndroid, Dagger 2, and Retrofit in order to make requests to the open Pokemon API found here: https://pokeapi.co/. This is a work in progress and is intended as practice of the technologies mentioned above as opposed to a user facing application.
